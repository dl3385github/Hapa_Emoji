### **Hapa Emoji Validator Product Requirements**  
**Compatible with Hapa Ecosystem v1.2+**  

---

### **Product Overview**
The Hapa Emoji Validator is a standalone application that enables the encoding and decoding of Hapa tokens, contracts, and metadata into emojis using Unicode Variation Selectors. This module extends the Hapa ecosystem with a visual, user-friendly method of representing digital assets and contracts.

### **Tech Stack**
- **Frontend**: React + JSX with Vite build tool
- **Backend**: Node.js
- **Deployment**: Standalone app with potential for Hapa Ecosystem integration

### **Functional Requirements**

| **ID** | **Requirement** | **Description** | **Priority** |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|--------------|
| FR-01 | Emoji Encoding | Encode payloads (tokens, DIDs, timestamps) into emojis using Unicode Variation Selectors. | High |
| FR-02 | Emoji Decoding | Extract hidden data from emojis and validate structure. | High |
| FR-03 | Emoji Keyboard | Provide a UI component that easily supports various emojis via clicking or typing /emojiname. | High |
| FR-04 | UI Components | Web-view with encoder form, decoder textarea, and hover tooltips. | High |
| FR-05 | Consul Governance | Allow Consuls to define custom emojis via JSON templates (stored in Hyperdrive). | Medium |
| FR-06 | Security Validation | Scan payloads for invalid DIDs, oversized data, or malicious bytes. | High |
| FR-07 | Token Mapping | Map emojis to Hapa tokens (`üçå` ‚Üí Bananas, `üåπ` ‚Üí Roses, `üåª` ‚Üí Don). | High |
| FR-08 | Transaction Validation | Validate transactions locally (e.g., check sender's balance). | Medium |
| FR-09 | Tooltip Display | Show decoded data summary on hover (e.g., "üçå500 from did:hapa:123"). | Medium |
| FR-10 | Custom Emoji Support | Support Consul-defined custom emoji templates. | Low |

### **Non-Functional Requirements**

| **ID** | **Requirement** | **Description** | **Metric** |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|------------|
| NF-01 | Performance | Encode/decode latency < 100ms on consumer hardware. | Latency test |
| NF-02 | Compatibility | Support Chrome, Firefox, and Hapa's Electron client. | Cross-browser testing |
| NF-03 | Payload Size | Maximum 64 bytes (16 VS) per emoji. | Byte count validation |
| NF-04 | Localization | UI supports English (default) and Consul-defined languages. | Language settings |
| NF-05 | Usability | Users can complete encoding/decoding tasks within 3 clicks. | User testing |
| NF-06 | Security | All encoded data must be validated before processing. | Security audit |
| NF-07 | Modularity | Code follows modular design principles for easy integration with Hapa ecosystem. | Code review |
| NF-08 | Responsiveness | UI must be responsive across desktop and mobile devices. | Multi-device testing |

### **User Stories**

#### **1. Token Transfer**
**As a** Hapa user,  
**I want to** encode token transfers as emojis,  
**So that** I can share them easily in messages and social media.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- User can select a token emoji (`üçå`, `üåπ`, `üåª`)
- User can specify amount, recipient DID, and optional message
- System generates a VS-encoded emoji that contains all transaction details
- Recipient can decode the emoji to see transaction details
- System validates transaction details before processing

#### **2. Contract Creation**
**As a** Consul member,  
**I want to** create a job contract emoji template,  
**So that** community members can easily create standardized contracts.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Consul can define a template for contract emojis (e.g., `üìù`)
- Template includes required fields (task, deadline, payment)
- Users can fill in template fields through the encoder UI
- System generates a VS-encoded contract emoji
- Recipients can decode the contract and view all terms

#### **3. Transaction Validation**
**As a** Gatekeeper,  
**I want to** validate emoji-encoded transactions,  
**So that** only legitimate transactions are processed.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- System extracts transaction details from emoji
- System verifies sender's DID authenticity
- System checks sender's token balance
- System validates transaction against Hapa ecosystem rules
- System accepts or rejects transaction with appropriate feedback

### **Constraints**

- Must work with Hapa Ecosystem v1.2+
- Must maintain compatibility with Hypercore Protocol v10.3+
- Emoji encoding must survive copy-paste operations across platforms
- Must comply with Hapa's security standards for token transactions
- UI must follow Hapa's design language and user experience guidelines
